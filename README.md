# AP Computer Science A

While preparing for the exam, I created a simple cheat sheet that should help you remember what you learned.
Be careful! This is a cheat sheet. It is not supposed to magically teach you everything. You should still study everything.
However having all the information neccesary condensed into a single file is useful.

FYI, I scored a 5.
